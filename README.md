# top_library

This is a simple webpage project for an online library storage, to be able to
keep track of books the user has or has not read. Features include:
 - Being able to add a new book to the library.
 - Being able to remove a book from the library.
 - Being able to change an already added book's read state. eg. from 'unread' to 'read', or 'read' to 'unread'.

This project was part of The Odin Project's Full Stack Javascript curriculum. The main goal was to learn how the prototype works and how to use it.
